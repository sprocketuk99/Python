Algorithm
(Year Code + Month Code + Century Code + Date Number - Leap Year Code) mod 7

Year code:-

YY is the last two digits of the year. For the year 1879, it’s 79.

First, divide YY by 4 and discard the remainder: 79 div 4 = 19.
print (int(79/4)  for example 

Then add 19 back into the YY number, which is 79 in this case, resulting in 98.

The next step is: 98 mod 7.
PRINT(98%7) IN PYTHON

“Mod” means divide the number and keep only the remainder. 98 / 7 = 14, and the remainder is 0, so 0 is our Year Code for 1879.

Month codes
January = 0
February = 3
March = 3
April = 6
May = 1
June = 4
July = 6
August = 2
September = 5
October = 0
November = 3
December = 5

Century codes
1800s = 2
1900s = 0
2000s = 6

If you can divide a Gregorian year by 4, it’s a leap year, unless it’s divisible by 100. But it is a leap year if it’s divisible by 400.
(this needs booleans)

1992 is a leap year because you can divide it by four.
1900 is not a leap year because you can divide it by 100.
2000 is a leap year because you can divide it by 400.

***leap year code is ewither 0 or 1***


(Year Code + Month Code + Century Code + Date Number - Leap Year Code) mod 7
0 = Sunday
1 = Monday
2 = Tuesday
3 = Wednesday
4 = Thursday
5 = Friday
6 = Saturday

To help avoid communication mistakes, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed ISO 8601. This standard specifies that all dates should be written in order of most-to-least-significant data. This means the format is year, month, day, hour, minute, and second:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:S
